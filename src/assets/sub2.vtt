00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
Apollo 12

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.420
Pete Conrad, Commander

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.800
Richard Gordon, Command Module Pilot

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.940
Alan Bean, Lunar Module Pilot

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940
Ignition sequence start in

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.680
Six

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.360
Five

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.400
Four

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.240
Three

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.140
Two

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.040
One

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.980
Zero

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.960
All engines running

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.960
Commit lift-off

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.280
Pete Conrad reports the yaw program is in.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.480
Tower clear

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.440
Apollo 12 was struck by lightning seconds after launch twice.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.360
I don't know what happened here.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.560
We had everything in the world drop out.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.240
I got three fuel cell lights, an AC bus light, a fuel cell disconnect

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.000
AC bus overload 1 and 2, main bus A and B out

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.800
Luckily, Flight controller John Aaron had seen the same unusual readings in a flight simulation.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.960
The fix was resetting an obscure system called Signal Conditioning Equipment (SCE).

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
Apollo 12, Houston, try SCE to Auxiliary, over

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000
NCE to Auxiliary?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.120
What the hell's that?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.520
S-C-E, S-C-E to Auxiliary

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.360
Apollo 12, Houston,  try to reset your fuel
cells now

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.520
Okay. I have a good GDC, and Al has got the fuel cells back on, and we'll be working on our AC buses.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.800
Automatic guidance brought Apollo 12 to their target on the Ocean of Storms.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.240
Conrad and Bean made a precision landing just 535 feet from the Surveyor 3 spacecraft.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320
There it is! Son of a gun- straight down the middle of the road! I can't believe it!

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.680
Amazing! Fantastic!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.160
Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.860
Pete Conrad &  Alan Bean did two moonwalks in two days

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.180
They collected lunar samples ...

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.260
retrieved parts of Surveyor 3 to study the long-term effects of exposure ...

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.680
and deployed the first Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) to study ...

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.920
moonquakes

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.380
ions

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.560
magnetic fields

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.260
solar wind

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.320
and lunar dust

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.420
The ascent module was jettisoned to impact the moon.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.480
countdown LM impact in 3 2 1 ... mark

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.080
NASA observed seismic activity on the Moon for the first time.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.880
To the surprise of seismologists, some signals lasted an hour.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.900
Hello Houston, Apollo 12 en route home

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.480
We're getting a spectacular view of the eclipse.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.940
Splashdown November 24, 1969

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.080
Designed for a life of one year, ALSEP continued to send data back for 8 years.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.000
The lunar samples are still studied today.
