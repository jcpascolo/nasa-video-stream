00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.912
The Hubble Space Telescope has given us

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.282
an incredible image for its 30th birthday.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.687
This image reveals a beautiful nursery
for new stars

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.758
in a nearby satellite galaxy
to our own Milky Way.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:28.194
The bright, newly-formed stars
in the middle of this image

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:32.232
are at least ten times more
massive than our Sun.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:36.536
Powerful radiation from these stars
is causing the surrounding gas

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.305
to glow in stunning colors.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.875
The blue indicates oxygen gas

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.478
heated to nearly 20,000
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:49.449
The red indicates the presence
of nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.886
Those massive stars are also
driving powerful winds

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.588
of charged particles
which are sculpting out

00:00:55.588 --> 00:01:00.293
the bubble and ridge structures
we can see across the nebula.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.297
The blue nebula at the lower left
of the image is actually

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:08.668
material ejected from a single
huge star in the center,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:13.306
that star is 200,000 times
brighter than our Sun.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.377
The whole region shows how
dynamic our universe is

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:21.481
with stars continuing to form
and affect their surroundings.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:26.286
And it's Hubble's exquisite vision
from its orbit above Earth's atmosphere

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.622
that gives us the ability to
get a clear glimpse

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.828
of this kind of incredible
beauty and activity.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:39.165
The Hubble Space Telescope has
changed the way we think of space

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.201
and our place in
the universe.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:45.171
Hubble has refined our understanding
of the age of the universe

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.707
and its rate of expansion.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:52.178
And through its deep fields it has
peered across billions of light-years

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.081
to reveal ancient,
adolescent galaxies

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.184
we can compare with
our own Milky Way.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.787
It has shown us the
telltale effects

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:04.691
of mysterious dark energy
and dark matter.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.927
And it has given us a front row
seat to these beautiful

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.231
interstellar clouds, and nebulas,
where new stars

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.134
and their surrounding disks
of dust and planets

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.035
continue to form.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:18.538
Hubble is in excellent
technical health

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.075
and is expected to continue
its exploration of the universe

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.344
for quite a few years
to come.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.946
Multiple astronaut missions
to service

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.249
the Hubble Space Telescope
over the years

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.752
have kept Hubble at the
forefront of capability.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.822
With each servicing mission,
astronauts repaired,

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.891
or replaced instrumentation,

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.593
keeping Hubble better
than ever before.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:45.098
The final servicing mission in 2009
was extremely successful

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.468
so that even today, Hubble is
more scientifically powerful

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.870
and productive than
ever before.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.073
