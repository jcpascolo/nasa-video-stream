Hello. I'm NASA associate administrator
for science Thomas Zurbuchen. NASA is

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.119
going to the moon with the Artemis
program and American companies of all

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.359
sizes want to help our nation make its
next giant leap. It is my pleasure to

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.890
announce the companies who are joining
the pool of NASA industry partners who

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.569
will help our nation enable the first
woman and next man to reach the lunar

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:37.960
surface by 2024 and conduct significant
science investigations. Through NASA's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.920
Commercial Lunar Payload Services, we're
sending science and technology

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.280
demonstrations to the lunar surface
beginning in 2021. These payloads will

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.790
help us study the Moon and prove
technologies that we'll need to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.290
eventually travel to Mars. Today five new
companies join this great initiative.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.350
I want to congratulate the new CLPS
participants:

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.900
Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra
Nevada Corporation, SpaceX and Tyvak

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.810
Nano-Satellite Systems. We look forward to working with all of you. Together, we are

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.640
going.
it's great to be going back to the Moon.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.810
An opportunity like this is the reason
why many of us got into the space

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.010
industry. Blue Origin will be offering
its Blue Moon lander, the one that we've

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.290
been working on for several years. With
its BE 7 engine that we've been test-

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.440
firing at Marshall Space Flight Center,
to the kilowatts of power it will

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.360
provide to help it survive noon or night,
to it's flexible payload deck that will

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.620
support everything from instruments to
rovers. We're confident that this lander

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.600
can support all of our needs from
exploration to science as America

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.570
returns to the surface of the Moon, this
time to stay.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.330
We're delighted to have the opportunity
to participate in NASA CLPS program

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.399
and to provide landers and deliver
payloads to the Moon's surface. Over the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.569
last sixty years, NASA and its partners
that created the opportunities we have

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.330
today to go back to the Moon to go onto
Mars and beyond. Thanks to NASA and all

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.890
who made this possible.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.180
Hi. Steve Lindsey here. I'm senior vice
president of strategy for SNC Space

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.740
Systems business area. SNC is thrilled to
have been selected for Commercial Lunar

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.670
Payload Services to support Artemis
missions and the next stage of lunar

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.020
exploration. For CLPS, we'll be applying
experience and knowledge from our lunar

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.980
gateway programs, satellites and cargo
resupply services for Space Station

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.060
through our Dream Chaser spacecraft.
CLPS is an amazing opportunity to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.530
advance science, exploration and learn
more about the lunar surface. Thank you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.580
NASA for your trust. SNC is proud to
partner with you again and we can't wait

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.200
to get working on CLPS and many other
programs.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.790
Hey everybody we are super excited that
NASA selected us for the CLPS program.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.840
I think starship is going to be an
extraordinary help and benefit, deliver

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.510
both science, technology and even cargo
to the lunar surface. Starship is a great

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.920
vehicle. It's fully reusable, so not only
can it take a lot to the surface of the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.640
Moon, but it's also quite affordable.
Thanks to NASA we are the company that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.299
we are today and we're really thrilled
to continue the partnership on the

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.930
CLPS program.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.470
We look forward to working with our
partners and apply flight proven

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.870
expertise to design, develop and operate
a lunar lander to the Moon's surface.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.010
We continue to value our relationship and
we'd like to thank NASA for including us

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.940
in such an instrumental project.
